1- Reducers:
 -Reducer is a function that allows us to centralize state updates in a component.
 -it will help us to:
   Reuse our state with multiple components.
   Centralize our state logic.
   Better separation of concerns.

   -when creating a Reducer if a prop inside the action can be undefined it's likely obligatory to create two interfaces:



  2- React Context:
   -Context allows sharing data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
   -The steps to share state using React Context are:
     1-Left the state up to the closest parent.
     2-Create a context.(track for transporting data)
     3-Set up a provider to wrap the parent component and set the context value.
     4- acess state using the context hook.
